# ECE Wellness

Hi there. I'm Aiden.

I'm the University of Waterloo's ECE2026 wellness representative for the Spring 2024 term.

My job is to work wit

## Want to talk anonymously?

You can message me on [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/id2XJDPw4gdtD8Avvs25yJVuUbKS7bpg8SvXd1WhPyg_sqVFt2NGe7XpMB9uN38k).

You will be completely anonymous to me. From there you can discuss your needs and I can help with resources.

## Want to set up a visit with the wellness coordinator?

You can email Kora at [ksevo@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:ksevo@uwaterloo.ca).

Alternatively, you can set up a direct meeting with [this link](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/bkg-ECEWellnessCoordinator@uwaterloo.ca/bookings/).

### Will I be forced to disclose anything to professors / family / administation?

No! Any notes taken during sessions are encrypted with the pass key only accessible to Kora. There is no requirement for Kora
to disclose that you have had any appointments with her in the past. Administration cannot enquire, unless they have received your
permission.
